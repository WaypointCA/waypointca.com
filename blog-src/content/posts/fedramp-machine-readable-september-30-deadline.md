summary: "RFC-0024's machine-readable package requirements were confirmed in NTC-0009 and finalized in the Consolidated Rules for 2026, with initial compliance due September 30, 2026. They apply to existing Rev 5 certifications, not just new applicants, and most providers have not started."

If you hold a FedRAMP Rev 5 certification, you have a deadline in about seven weeks that has received almost none of the attention it deserves.

[RFC-0024](https://www.fedramp.gov/rfcs/0024/) proposed that FedRAMP providers produce machine-readable authorization packages so agency tooling can ingest authorization data directly instead of parsing documents. The RFC closed on March 11, 2026. FedRAMP confirmed the outcome in [public notice NTC-0009](https://www.fedramp.gov/notices/0009/) and folded the final requirements into the [Consolidated Rules for 2026](https://www.fedramp.gov/2026/), published in late June. NTC-0009 committed in writing that none of the deadline dates would move earlier, and nothing since has signaled they will move later. Initial compliance is due **September 30, 2026**, or at your next annual assessment following that date. The grace period runs to September 30, 2027, and what happens at the end of it is worth reading twice, so I cover it below.

The part that catches people is the scope. This is not a 20x requirement that only applies to providers entering the new program. It applies to existing Rev 5 certifications. If your package today is a set of Word documents and spreadsheets that a human reads, that package needs to become structured data on a published schedule, regardless of whether you have any intention of moving to 20x.

One more group needs to hear this: if you are mid-pipeline toward a Rev 5 certification right now, including packages In Process for agency authorization, FedRAMP will not accept your final package after September 30, 2026 unless it is in an approved machine-readable format. The rules state plainly that there is no grace period for new submissions, regardless of demand or delay.

## Why this exists

FedRAMP's reuse model has always had a gap between promise and practice. A certification is supposed to be reusable across agencies, but when the artifact is a 400-page document, every reusing agency assigns a human to read it. Reuse in theory, redundant review in practice.

Machine-readable packages close that gap. If authorization data is structured, an agency's GRC tooling can ingest it, compare it against their own requirements, and flag deltas without a person re-reading a narrative someone else already reviewed. It is also the necessary substrate for everything else in 20x, because continuous validation is meaningless if the output cannot be consumed automatically.

The rules are also explicit about what the government does not want, and it is worth quoting the concept precisely: the end state is machine-generated deterministic telemetry, meaning verifiable data collected directly from an authoritative source. The requirements state outright that generative AI output does not constitute a factual record of system state and must not be used to produce that telemetry. In other words, running your old SSP through a chatbot and reformatting the result is not a path through this. The government is done reading creative writing about your security posture, whether a human or a model wrote it.

This is the right call. It is also work, and the work has to happen inside your organization.

## What "machine-readable" actually means

In practice this means OSCAL, the Open Security Controls Assessment Language that NIST has been developing for years. Technically, FedRAMP's approved-formats rule leaves the door open for industry alternatives, since any public-domain format that five or more certified providers agree to adopt and maintain can be added to the list. OSCAL is the format on that list today, and no alliance has emerged to challenge it, so plan around OSCAL. It defines structured models for the artifacts you already produce:

- **SSP**, your system security plan
- **SAP**, the assessment plan
- **SAR**, the assessment results
- **POA&M**, your plan of action and milestones

Instead of prose describing a control implementation, you produce a structured document where each control implementation is an addressable object with defined relationships to components, parties, and evidence.

If you have never worked with OSCAL, set expectations accordingly. The models are more rigorous than they first appear, the validation is strict, and the tooling ecosystem is still maturing. The common failure is treating conversion as a formatting exercise, discovering that your existing documentation is internally inconsistent, and spending the schedule reconciling contradictions rather than converting anything.

That discovery is genuinely useful, but it takes time you may not have allocated.

## The three ways providers are handling this

**Convert manually.** Take your existing package and hand-author the OSCAL. Viable for a small, simple system. Painful and error-prone for anything else, and it produces an artifact that will drift from reality the moment anything changes.

**Buy tooling.** Several vendors now generate OSCAL from their own compliance platforms. Fastest path if you are already in one of those ecosystems, and a meaningful commitment if you are not, because you are adopting a platform to satisfy a format requirement.

**Generate it from your actual environment.** Build a pipeline that produces OSCAL from your real system of record: infrastructure as code, asset inventory, identity configuration. Most work upfront, and the only one of the three that produces a package that stays accurate without a person maintaining it.

The third option is the one that pays off, because the same pipeline is most of what you need for 20x continuous validation later, and it is the only one that moves you toward the deterministic telemetry the rules actually reward. FedRAMP has said providers who build in machine-generated telemetry will rank higher in the Marketplace and receive additional support. If you are going to do this work, do it in a way that is not thrown away in eighteen months when the rest of the program catches up to you.

## What to do in the next seven weeks

1. **Confirm your actual date.** The requirement is September 30, 2026 or your next annual assessment after it. Find out which applies to you before you plan anything, because the difference can be most of a year.

2. **Inventory what you have.** SSP, SAP, SAR, POA&M, inventory workbook, and any control implementation summaries. Identify which are current and which have quietly drifted from the running system.

3. **Reconcile before you convert.** OSCAL validation will surface every inconsistency between documents. Finding those now, on your schedule, is much better than finding them in a validator error two weeks before the deadline.

4. **Pick your conversion path deliberately.** Manual, tooling, or generated. Do not default into manual conversion simply because it is the option that requires no decision.

5. **Validate early and often.** Get one artifact through OSCAL validation cleanly before you attempt all of them. The first one teaches you the patterns; the rest go far faster.

6. **Decide whether this is a conversion or a migration.** If you are going to 20x eventually, and the published timeline says you are, building a generation pipeline now rather than converting documents once is the better investment.

## What non-compliance actually costs

This is not a paperwork finding, so be clear-eyed about the enforcement mechanics. During the grace period, providers that miss their requirement get publicly named by FedRAMP as pending revocation, with progressive corrective actions applied on a rolling basis. After 2PM ET on September 30, 2027, the grace period ends and non-compliant services lose FedRAMP Certification outright, along with any legacy exceptions that depended on it, and getting back in means a completely new initial authorization under whatever rules exist at that time.

Public shaming on a federal website, followed by revocation and a full do-over. That is the downside you are managing against.

## The strategic point

Providers are treating this as a compliance chore, and it is, but it is also a preview. September 30, 2026 is the first date on which FedRAMP requires your compliance artifacts to be consumable by a machine. June 11, 2027 closes new Rev 5 applications. September 30, 2027 is when non-compliant Rev 5 providers start losing their certifications.

The direction is not ambiguous, the dates are published, and FedRAMP has committed they will not move earlier. The question is only whether you spend the next seven weeks producing a one-time conversion you will redo later, or whether you start building the pipeline you are going to need regardless. I laid out where that pipeline leads, and what 20x asks of a provider beyond this one deadline, in [FedRAMP 20x Turns Compliance Into Code]({{< ref "fedramp-20x-compliance-becomes-code.md" >}}).

Seven weeks is enough time to do this well if you start now. It is not enough time if you start in September.
